    "The ideas of recognizability and diversity of a data set introducted by Boutin et al. (2022) are used to evaluate the ability of a generative model to create useful data. The recognizability metric is easiest to understand as simply how easy (or difficult) it is for the data to be classified. Therefore, in the case of the drone data it is just a measure of how easily the drone objects can be identified within the images. Diversity is best thought of as the variance of the feature space of the data set."
